## 💡 How to Use These Notebooks

1. **Click any link above** - it will open in Google Colab
2. **Sign in with your Google account** (Sussex email works!)
3. **Copy to your Drive**: `File → Save a copy in Drive`
4. **Run code cells**: Click the play button or press `Shift + Enter`
5. **Experiment**: Change values, break things, learn!

## 🎯 Learning Tips

### Do:

- ✅ Type code yourself (don't just copy-paste)
- ✅ Run every cell and read the output
- ✅ Try the exercises at the end of each notebook
- ✅ Experiment with changing values
- ✅ Ask questions when stuck

### Don't:

- ❌ Rush through without understanding
- ❌ Skip notebooks (they build on each other)
- ❌ Be afraid of errors (they help you learn!)
- ❌ Use AI to write code for you (you won't learn)

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
y3-bio-python/
├── notebooks/
│   └── lecture_1/        # All Lecture 1 notebooks
├── data/

├── main.py               # Example Python script
└── README.md             # This file
```

## 🆘 Getting Help

1. **In Colab**: Read error messages carefully - they often tell you what's wrong
2. **Slack Channel**: Ask your classmates and TAs
3. **Lab Sessions**: Bring your questions to the practical sessions
4. **Office Hours**: Thursdays 2-4pm with Dr. Hochegger

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "I can't run the code!"

- Make sure you're signed into Google
- Click the play button next to the code cell
- Check if you missed running earlier cells

### "My code doesn't work!"

- Read the error message (usually the last line)
- Check for typos (Python is case-sensitive!)
- Make sure you ran all previous cells in order

### "I lost my work!"

- Always use `File → Save a copy in Drive`
- Your work auto-saves every few minutes
- Check your Google Drive for saved copies

## 📝 Course Philosophy

> "You can't learn Python from lectures alone - you must write code!"

This course gives you the tools and direction, but the learning happens when you:

- Type code yourself
- Make mistakes and fix them
- Build something useful
- Practice regularly
